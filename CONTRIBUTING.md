# Contributing

Thank you for considering contributing to json-server. We want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:
                                                 
- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features

## Our Development Process
We use GitHub to sync code to and from our internal repository. We'll use GitHub to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

## Pull Requests
Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase. We actively welcome your pull requests:

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `master`.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3. Make sure your code lints. (`golangci-lint run`)
4. Ensure the test suite passes. (`go test ./...`)
5. Issue that pull request

## Issues
We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by [opening a new issue](https://github.com/chanioxaris/json-server/issues/new); it's that easy! 

Please ensure your description is clear and has sufficient instructions to be able to reproduce the issue.
